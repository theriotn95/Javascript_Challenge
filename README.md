## Javascript-Challenge - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

###  Automatic Table and Date Search 

* In this challenege I created a basic HTML web page using the u_index.html. 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects I was able to write code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

* I used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listened for events and searched through the `date/time` column to find rows that matched the user filter input.
